# The concept of tidy data
A lot of analysis time is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing
the data. Data preparation is not just a first step, but must be
repeated many over the course of analysis as new problems come to light or new data is
collected. An often neglected, but important aspect of data cleaning is
data tidying: structuring datasets to facilitate analysis.


This "data tidying" includes the ability to move
data between different different shapes.


In a nutshell, a  dataset is a collection of values, usually either numbers
(if quantitative) or
strings (if qualitative). Values are organized in two ways. Every value belongs to a
variable and an observation. A variable contains all values that measure the same
underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units.

An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day,
or a race) across attributes.

A tidy data frame now organizes the data in such a way that
each observation corresponds to an single line in the data set.
This is in general the most appropriate format for downstream analysis, although
it might not be the most appropriate form for viewing the data.

For a thorough discussion of this topic see the paper by
[Hadley Wickham - tidy data](\href{http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper).
